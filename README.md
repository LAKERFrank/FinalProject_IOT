## 1. Introduction
### Why we need ball return system
In order to improve your game, you must devote a lot of time to practice. Dribbling, passing, and shooting are easy places to start practicing, and having a friend work out and improve their game alongside you is super rewarding. But what about those times when you have to get some shots up and no one is there to rebound for you?

ball return systems have been all the rage for well over two decades helping college and professional teams workout quicker and smarter.

### Who should get one
Any player who wants to improve their shot needs a good return system. While there’s nothing wrong with rebounding, being able to sit in one spot gives you better muscle memory from a certain area. It also allows you to get a better feel for an in-game shooting rhythm.

## 2. Fastiball
### motivation
I want to play basketball but pick up the ball that doesn't come to your way is the last thing I want to experience. And mostly I stay in dormitory. In that way, I would like to create some product that can solve my problem. That is Fastiball. 
### easier
Despite being a tremendous product with heavy weight and can only be used out door. Fastiball can be use indoor or even in the dormitory.
